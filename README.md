# ðŸ§  Continual Learning with Transformers (EWC + Replay)

This project demonstrates continual learning using RoBERTa on a sequence of text classification tasks:
1. Sentiment Classification (IMDb)
2. Topic Classification (AG News)
3. Intent Classification (SNIPS)

We compare three approaches:
- âœ… Baseline (no forgetting prevention)
- âœ… EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation)
- âœ… Replay Buffer

Includes evaluation plots and dataset loaders.
